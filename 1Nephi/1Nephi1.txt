An account of Lehi and his wife Sariah, and his four Sons,  being called, (beginning at the eldest,) Laman, Lemuel,  Sam, and Nephi. The Lord warns Lehi to depart out of  the land of Jerusalem, because he prophesieth unto the peo ple concerning their iniquity; and they seek to destroy his  life. He taketh three days’ journey into the wilderness  with his family. Nephi taketh his brethren and returns to  the land of Jerusalem after the record of the Jews. The ac count of their sufferings. They take the daughters of Ish mael to wife. They take their families and depart into the  wilderness. Their sufferings and afflictions in the wilder ness. The course of their travels. They come to the large  waters. Nephi’s brethren rebelleth against him. He con foundeth them, and buildeth a Ship. They call the place  Bountiful. They cross the large waters into the promised  land, &c. This is according to the account of Nephi; or,  in other words, I Nephi wrote this record.
 
I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents, therefore I  was taught somewhat in all the learning of my father; and  having seen many afflictions in the course of my days—never theless, having been highly favored of the Lord in all my days;  yea, having had a great knowledge of the goodness and the  mysteries of God, therefore I make a record of my procee dings in my days; yea, I make a record in the language of my  father, which consists of the learning of the Jews and the lan guage of the Egyptians. And I know that the record which I  make, to be true; and I make it with mine own hand; and I  make it according to my knowledge.
For it came to pass, in the commencement of the first year  of the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah, (my father Lehi hav ing dwelt at Jerusalem in all his days;) and in that same year  there came many prophets, prophesying unto the people, that  they must repent, or the great city Jerusalem must be destroyed. [p. [5]] Wherefore it came to pass, that my father Lehi, as he went  forth, prayed unto the Lord, yea, even with all his heart, in  behalf of his people.
And it came to pass, as he prayed unto the Lord, there  came a pillar of fire and dwelt upon a rock before him; and  he saw and heard much; and because of the things which he  saw and heard, he did quake and tremble exceedingly.
And it came to pass that he returned to his own house at  Jerusalem; and he cast himself upon his bed, being overcome  with the spirit and the things which he had seen; and being  thus overcome with the spirit, he was carried away in a vis ion, even that he saw the Heavens open; and he thought he  saw God sitting upon his throne, surrounded with numberless  concourses of angels in the attitude of singing and praising  their God.
And it came to pass that he saw one descending out of the  midst of Heaven, and he beheld that his lustre was above that  of the sun at noon-day; and he also saw twelve others follow ing him, and their brightness did exceed that of the stars in  the firmament; and they came down and went forth upon the  face of the earth; and the first came and stood before my fa ther, and gave unto him a Book, and bade him that he should  read.
And it came to pass that as he read, he was filled with the  spirit of the Lord, and he read, saying, Wo, wo unto Jerusa lem! for I have seen thine abominations; yea, and many  things did my father read concerning Jerusalem—that it should  be destroyed, and the inhabitants thereof, many should perish  by the sword, and many should be carried away captive into  Babylon.
And it came to pass that when my father had read and saw  many great and marvellous things, he did exclaim many things  unto the Lord; such as, Great and marvellous are thy works,  O Lord God Almighty! Thy throne is high in the Heavens,  and thy power, and goodness, and mercy is over all the inhabi tants of the earth; and because thou art merciful, thou wilt  not suffer those who come unto thee that they shall perish!  And after this manner was the language of my father in the  praising of his God; for his soul did rejoice, and his whole  heart was filled, because of the things which he had seen; yea,  which the Lord had shewn unto him. And now I, Nephi, do  not make a full account of the things which my father hath  written, for he hath written many things which he saw in vis [p. 6] ions and in dreams; and he also hath written many things  which he prophesied and spake unto his children, of which I  shall not make a full account; but I shall make an account of  my proceedings in my days—Behold I make an abridgment of  the record of my father, upon plates which I have made with  mine own hands; wherefore, after that I have abridged the  record of my father, then will I make an account of mine own  life.
Therefore, I would that ye should know that after the Lord  had shewn so many marvellous things unto my father Lehi,  yea, concerning the destruction of Jerusalem, behold he went  forth among the people, and began to prophesy and to de clare unto them concerning the things which he had both seen  and heard.
And it came to pass that the Jews did mock him because  of the things which he testified of them; for he truly testified  of their wickedness and their abominations; and he testified  that the things which he saw and heard, and also the things  which he read in the Book, manifested plainly of the coming  of a Messiah, and also the redemption of the world.
And when the Jews heard these things, they were angry  with him; yea, even as with the prophets of old, whom they had  cast out and stoned and slain; and they also sought his life,  that they might take it away. But behold, I, Nephi, will shew  unto you that the tender mercies of the Lord is over all them  whom he hath chosen, because of their faith, to make them  mighty even unto the power of deliverance.
For behold it came to pass that the Lord spake unto my fa ther, yea, even in a dream, and sayeth unto him, Blessed art  thou Lehi, because of the things which thou hast done; and be cause thou hast been faithful and declared unto this people the  things which I commanded thee, behold they seek to take  away thy life.
And it came to pass that the Lord commanded my father,  even in a dream, that he should take his family and depart into  the wilderness. And it came to pass that he was obedient un to the word of the Lord, wherefore he did as the Lord com manded him.
And it came to pass that he departed into the wilderness.—  And he left his house, and the land of his inheritance, and his  gold, and his silver, and his precious things, and took nothing  with him save it were his family, and provisions, and tents, and  he departed into the wilderness; and he came down by the [p. 7] borders near the shore of the Red Sea; and he travelled in  the wilderness, in the borders, which was nearer the Red Sea;  and he did travel in the wilderness with his family, which con sisted of my mother, Sariah, and my elder brothers, which  were Laman, Lemuel and Sam.
And it came to pass that when he had travelled three days  in the wilderness, he pitched his tent in a valley beside a river  of water. And it came to pass that he built an altar of stones,  and he made an offering unto the Lord, and gave thanks unto  the Lord our God. And it came to pass that he called the  name of the river Laman, and it emptied into the Red Sea;  and the valley was in the borders near the mouth thereof.
And when my father saw that the waters of the river emp tied into the fountain of the Red Sea, he spake unto Laman, saying: O that thou mightest be like unto this river, continually  running into the fountain of all righteousness. And he also  spake unto Lemuel: O that thou mightest be like unto this val ley, firm, and steadfast, and immovable in keeping the com mandments of the Lord. Now this he spake because of the  stiffneckedness of Laman and Lemuel; for behold, they did  murmur in many things against their father, because that he  was a visionary man, and that he had led them out of the land  of Jerusalem, to leave the land of their inheritance, and their  gold, and their silver, and their precious things, and to perish  in the wilderness. And this they said he had done because of  the foolish imaginations of his heart. And thus Laman and  Lemuel, being the eldest, did murmur against their father.—  And they did murmur because they knew not the dealings of  that God who had created them. Neither did they believe that  Jerusalem, that great city, could be destroyed according to the  words of the prophets. And they were like unto the Jews,  which were at Jerusalem, which sought to take away the life of  my father.
And it came to pass that my father did speak unto them in  the valley of Lemuel, with power, being filled with the spirit,  until their frames did shake before him. And he did confound  them, that they durst not utter against him; wherefore they  did do as he commanded them. And my father dwelt in a  tent.
And it came to pass that I, Nephi, being exceeding young,  nevertheless being large in stature, and also having great de sires to know of the mysteries of God, wherefore I did cry  unto the Lord; and behold he did visit me, and did soften my [p. 8] heart that I did believe all the words which had been spoken  by my father; wherefore I did not rebel against him like unto  my brothers. And I spake unto Sam, making known unto  him the things which the Lord had manifested unto me by his  Holy Spirit.
And it came to pass that he believed in my words; but be hold Laman and Lemuel would not hearken unto my words:  And being grieved because of the hardness of their hearts, I  cried unto the Lord for them.
And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto me, saying:  Blessed art thou, Nephi, because of thy faith, for thou hast  sought me diligently, with lowliness of heart. And inasmuch  as ye shall keep my commandments, ye shall prosper, and shall  be led to a land of promise; yea, even a land which I have  prepared for you; yea, a land which is choice above all other  lands. And inasmuch as thy brethren shall rebel against thee,  they shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord. And inas much as thou shalt keep my commandments, thou shalt be  made a ruler and a teacher over thy brethren. For behold, in  that day that they shall rebel against me, I will curse them  even with a sore curse, and they shall have no power over  thy seed, except they shall rebel against me also. And if it  so be that they rebel against me, they shall be a scourge unto  thy seed, to stir them up in the ways of remembrance.
And it came to pass that I, Nephi, returned from speaking  with the Lord, to the tent of my father. And it came to pass  that he spake unto me, saying: Behold I have dreamed a dream,  in the which the Lord hath commanded me that thou and thy  brethren shall return to Jerusalem. For behold, Laban hath  the record of the Jews, and also a genealogy of my forefathers,  and they are engraven upon plates of brass. Wherefore the  Lord hath commanded me that thou and thy brothers should  go unto the house of Laban, and seek the records, and bring  them down hither into the wilderness. And now, behold, thy  brothers murmur, saying: It is a hard thing which I have re quired of them; but behold I have not required it of them, but  it is a commandment of the Lord. Therefore go, my son, and  thou shalt be favored of the Lord, because thou hast not mur mured.
And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father, I  will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded,  for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the [p. 9] children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that  they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.
And it came to pass that when my father had heard these  words, he was exceeding glad, for he knew that I had been  blessed of the Lord. And I, Nephi, and my brethren, took  our journey in the wilderness with our tents, to go up to the  land of Jerusalem.
And it came to pass that when we had come up to the land  of Jerusalem, I and my brethren did consult one with another;  and we cast lots which of us should go in unto the house of  Laban. And it came to pass that the lot fell upon Laman; and  Laman went in unto the house of Laban, and he talked with  him as he sat in his house. And he desired of Laban the rec ords which were engraven upon the plates of brass, which con tained the genealogy of my father.
And behold, it came to pass that Laban was angry, and  thrust him out from his presence; and he would not that he  should have the records. Wherefore he said unto him, behold  thou art a robber, and I will slay thee. But Laman fled out of  his presence, and told the things which Laban had done, unto  us. And we began to be exceeding sorrowful, and my brethren  were about to return unto my father in the wilderness. But  behold I said unto them, that as the Lord liveth, and as we live,  we will not go down unto our father in the wilderness, until  we have accomplished the thing which the Lord hath comman ded us. Wherefore let us be faithful in keeping the command ments of the Lord; therefore let us go down to the land of our  father’s inheritance, for behold he left gold and silver, and all  manner of riches. And all this he hath done, because of the  commandments of the Lord: for he knowing that Jerusalem  must be destroyed, because of the wickedness of the people.
For behold, they have rejected the words of the prophets—  Wherefore if my father should dwell in the land after that he  hath been commanded to flee out of the land, behold he would  also perish. Wherefore it must needs be that he flee out of  the land. And behold, it is wisdom in God that we should  obtain these records, that we might preserve unto our children  the language of our fathers; and also that we may preserve  unto them the words which have been spoken by the mouth of  all the holy prophets, which have been delivered unto them by  the spirit and power of God, since the world began, even down  unto this present time. [p. 10]
And it came to pass that after this manner of language did  I persuade my brethren, that they might be faithful in keeping  the commandments of God. And it came to pass that we  went down to the land of our inheritance, and we did gather to gether our gold, and our silver, and our precious things. And  after that we had gathered these things together, we went up  again unto the house of Laban.
And it came to pass that we went in unto Laban, and desired  him that he would give unto us the records which were engra ven upon the plates of brass, for which we would give unto  him our gold, and our silver, and all our precious things.
And it came to pass that when Laban saw our property, and  that it was exceeding great, he did lust after it, insomuch that  he thrust us out, and sent his servants to slay us, that he might  obtain our property. And it came to pass that we did flee be fore the servants of Laban, and we were obliged to leave behind  our property, and it fell into the hands of Laban.
And it came to pass that we fled into the wilderness, and the  servants of Laban did not overtake us, and we hid ourselves  in the cavity of a rock. And it came to pass that Laman was  angry with me, and also with my father; and also was Lemuel;  for he hearkened unto the words of Laman. Wherefore La man and Lemuel did speak many hard words unto us, their  younger brothers, and they did smite us even with a rod.
And it came to pass as they smote us with a rod, behold an  angel of the Lord came and stood before them, and he spake  unto them saying: Why do ye smite your younger brother with  a rod? Know ye not that the Lord hath chosen him to be a  ruler over you, and this because of your iniquities? Behold  thou shalt go up to Jerusalem again, and the Lord will deliver  Laban into your hands. And after that the angel had spoken  unto us, he departed. And after that the angel had departed,  Laman and Lemuel again began to murmur, saying, how is it  possible that the Lord will deliver Laban into our hands? Be hold he is a mighty man, and he can command fifty, yea, even  he can slay fifty; then why not us?
And it came to pass that I spake unto my brethren, saying:  Let us go up again unto Jerusalem, and let us be faithful in  keeping the commandments of the Lord; for behold he is  mightier than all the earth, then why not mightier than Laban  and his fifty, yea, or even than his tens of thousands. There fore let us go up; let us be strong like unto Moses: For he  truly spake unto the waters of the Red Sea, and they divided [p. 11] hither and thither, and our fathers came through out of cap tivity on dry ground, and the armies of Pharaoh did follow and  were drowned in the waters of the Red Sea. Now behold  ye know that this is true; and ye also know that an angel  hath spoken unto you, wherefore can ye doubt. Let us go  up; the Lord is able to deliver us, even as our fathers, and to  destroy Laban, even as the Egyptians.
Now when I had spoken these words, they were yet wroth,  and did still continue to murmur; Nevertheless they did fol low me up until we came without the walls of Jerusalem. And  it was by night; and I caused that they should hide them selves without the walls. And after that they had hid them selves, I, Nephi, crept into the city and went forth towards the  house of Laban. And I was led by the spirit, not knowing  beforehand the things which I should do. Nevertheless I  went forth, and as I came near unto the house of Laban, I be held a man, and he had fallen to the earth before me, for he  was drunken with wine. And when I came to him, I found  that it was Laban. And I beheld his sword, and I drew it  forth from the sheath thereof, and the hilt thereof was of pure  gold, and the workmanship thereof was exceeding fine; and  I saw that the blade thereof was of the most precious steel.
And it came to pass that I was constrained by the spirit  that I should kill Laban; but I said in my heart, never at any  time have I shed the blood of man, and I shrunk and would  that I might not slay him. And the spirit saith unto me again,  behold the Lord hath delivered him into thy hands; yea, and  I also knew that he had sought to take away mine own life;  yea, and he would not hearken unto the commandments of  the Lord; and he also had taken away our property.
And it came to pass that the spirit said unto me again, slay  him, for the Lord hath delivered him into thy hands. Behold the  Lord slayeth the wicked to bring forth his righteous purposes:  It is better that one man should perish, than that a nation  should dwindle and perish in unbelief.
And now, when I, Nephi, had heard these words, I remem bered the words of the Lord which he spake unto me in the  wilderness, saying, that inasmuch as thy seed shall keep my  commandments, they shall prosper in the land of promise.—  Yea, and I also thought that they could not keep the com mandments of the Lord according to the law of Moses, save  they should have the law. And I also knew that the law was  engraven upon the plates of brass. And again—I knew that [p. 12] the Lord had delivered Laban into my hands, for this cause:  that I might obtain the records according to his commmand ments. Therefore I did obey the voice of the spirit, and took  Laban by the hair of the head, and I smote off his head with  his own sword.
And after that I had smitten off his head with his own sword,  I took the garments of Laban and put them upon mine own  body; yea, even every whit; and I did gird on his armour  about my loins. And after that I had done this, I went forth  unto the treasury of Laban. And as I went forth towards the  treasury of Laban, behold I saw the servant of Laban which had  the keys of the treasury. And I commanded him in the voice  of Laban, that he should go with me into the treasury; and he  supposed me to be his master, Laban, for he beheld the gar ments, and also the sword girted about my loins. And he  spake unto me concerning the elders of the Jews, he know ing that his master Laban had been out by night among them.  And I spake unto him as if it had been Laban. And I also  spake unto him that I should carry the engravings which were  upon the plates of brass, to my elder brethren, which were  without the walls. And I also bade him that he should fol low me. And he, supposing that I spake of the brethren of  the church, and that I was truly that Laban whom I had slain,  wherefore he did follow me. And he spake unto me many  times concerning the elders of the Jews, as I went forth unto  my brethren, which were without the walls.
And it came to pass that when Laman saw me, he was ex ceedingly frightened, and also Lemuel and Sam. And they  fled from before my presence; for they supposed it was La ban, and that he had slain me, and had sought to take away  their lives also.
And it came to pass that I called after them, and they did  hear me; wherefore they did cease to flee from my presence.  And it came to pass that when the servant of Laban beheld  my brethren, he began to tremble, and was about to flee from  before me and return to the city of Jerusalem.
And now I, Nephi, being a man large in stature, and also  having received much strength of the Lord, therefore I did  seize upon the servant of Laban, and held him, that he should  not flee.
And It came to pass that I spake with him, that if he would  hearken unto my words, as the Lord liveth and as I live, even  so that if he would hearken unto our words, we would spare [p. 13] his life. And I spake unto him, even with an oath, that he  need not fear; that he should be a free man like unto us, if  he would go down in the wilderness with us. And I also  spake unto him, saying, surely the Lord hath commanded us  to do this thing. And shall we not be diligent in keeping the  commandments of the Lord? Therefore, if thou wilt go down  into the wilderness to my father, thou shalt have place with us.
And it came to pass that Zoram did take courage at the  words which I spake. Now Zoram was the name of the ser vant; and he promised that he would go down into the wil derness unto our father. And he also made an oath unto us,  that he would tarry with us from that time forth. Now we  were desirous that he should tarry with us for this cause: that  the Jews might not know concerning our flight into the wilder ness, lest they should pursue us and destroy us.
And it came to pass that when Zoram had made an oath unto  us, our fears did cease concerning him. And it came to pass  that we took the plates of brass and the servant of Laban, and  departed into the wilderness, and journied unto the tent of  our father.
And it came to pass that after we had came down into the  wilderness unto our father, behold he was filled with joy, and  also my mother, Sariah, was exceeding glad, for she truly had  mourned because of us; for she had supposed that we had per ished in the wilderness; and she also had complained against  my father, telling him that he was a visionary man; saying,  behold thou hast led us forth from the land of our inheritance,  and my sons are no more, and we perish in the wilderness.  And after this manner of language had my mother complained  against my father.
And it had came to pass that my father spake unto her say ing: I know that I am a visionary man; for if I had not seen  the things of God in a vision, I should not have known the  goodness of God, but had tarried at Jerusalem and had per ished with my brethren. But behold, I have obtained a land  of promise, in the which thing I do rejoice; yea, and I know  that the Lord will deliver my sons out of the hands of Laban,  and bring them down again unto us in the wilderness. And  after this manner of language did my father Lehi comfort my  mother Sariah, concerning us, while we journied in the wil derness up to the land of Jerusalem, to obtain the record of  the Jews.
And when we had returned to the tent of my father, behold [p. 14] their joy was full, and my mother was comforted; and she  spake, saying: Now I know of a surety that the Lord hath com manded my husband to flee into the wilderness; yea, and I  also know of a surety that the Lord hath protected my sons  and delivered them out of the hands of Laban, and gave them  power whereby they could accomplish the thing which the  Lord hath commanded them. And after this manner of lan guage did she speak.
And it came to pass that they did rejoice exceedingly, and  did offer sacrifice and burnt offerings unto the Lord; and they  gave thanks unto the God of Israel. And after that they had  given thanks unto the God of Israel, my father Lehi took the  records which were engraven upon the plates of brass, and he  did search them from the beginning. And he beheld that  they did contain the five Books of Moses, which gave an ac count of the creation of the world, and also of Adam and Eve,  which was our first parents; and also a record of the Jews  from the beginning, even down to the commencement of the  reign of Zedekiah, King of Judah; and also the prophecies of  the Holy prophets, from the beginning, even down to the com mencement of the reign of Zedekiah; and also many proph ecies which have been spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah.
And it came to pass that my father Lehi also found upon the  plates of brass, a genealogy of his fathers; wherefore he knew  that he was a descendant of Joseph; yea, even that Joseph  which was the son of Jacob, which was sold into Egypt, and  which was preserved by the hand of the Lord, that he might  preserve his father Jacob and all his household from perishing  with famine. And they were also led out of captivity and  out of the land of Egypt, by that same God who had preserv ed them. And thus my father Lehi did discover the genealo gy of his fathers. And Laban also was a descendant of Jo seph, wherefore he and his fathers had kept the records.
And now when my father saw all these things, he was filled  with the spirit, and began to prophesy concerning his seed;  that these plates of brass should go forth unto all nations, kin dreds, tongues, and people which were of his seed. Where fore he said that these plates of brass should never perish;  neither should they be dimmed any more by time. And he proph esied many things concerning his seed.
And it came to pass that thus far I and my father had kept  the commandments wherewith the Lord had commanded us.  And we had obtained the record which the Lord had comman [p. 15] ded us, and searched them and found that they were desirable;  yea, even of great worth unto us, insomuch that we could  preserve the commandments of the Lord unto our children.  Wherefore it was wisdom in the Lord that we should carry  them with us, as we journied in the wilderness towards the  land of promise.
